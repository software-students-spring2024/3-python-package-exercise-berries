# Package Idea

We are building a frog 🐸, named ribbet, virtual pet that has four behaviors that can be called upon each with their own unique message/response. 

The unique responses will be
* hello: 🐸 'Hi there (user)'
* encourage: 🐸 'You got this'
* frog mode: 🐸 'I EAT BUGS, lets eat bugs together'
* bye: 🐸 'bye bye (user), go catch some flys'
