# Python Package Exercise

An exercise to create a Python package, build it, test it, distribute it, and use it. See [instructions](./instructions.md) for details.

# Package Idea

We are building a frog 🐸, named ribbet, virtual pet that has four behaviors that can be called upon each with their own unique message/response. 

The unique responses will be
* help: List of commands 
* hello (user): 🐸 'Hi there (user)'
* encourage: 🐸 'You got this'
* frog mode: 🐸 'I EAT BUGS, lets eat bugs together'
* kill(bug): 🐸 'I don't eat (bug), I like to eat yummy yummy flies'
* bye (user): 🐸 'bye bye (user), go catch some flys'

## Install 

Install the frog module using pip

```bash
  pip install frog 
```

## Run
Call frog from the command line to interact with your virtual frog while coding.

```bash
  frog 
```
note: put documentation and finish run instructions
